## Project Overview

This template provides a foundational setup for building Svelte applications, including:
- An API skeleton to get you started with backend logic.
- Basic routes for generating and managing API keys.
- Pre-configured settings for rapid development.

## Installation

To create a new project using this template, use the following command:

```bash
npx create-svelte-project-zero my-app
```

Replace `my-app` with your desired project name. This will clone the template into a new directory named `my-app`.

### Example

```bash
npx create-svelte-project-zero test-app-my
```

This command creates a new Svelte project in a directory called `test-app-my`.

## Usage

Once youâ€™ve cloned the template, navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

Install the dependencies using your package manager of choice:

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```
or
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

To start a development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) suitable for your target environment.
